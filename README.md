# Authors and Acknowledgments

    I would like to thank Vrisha Parekh, my learning team's Educational Assistant, for her support with this work.
    Unfortunatley, this project was released to us before the requisite content had been covered in lectures. As such, I needed some assistance getting started. 
    Vrisha was very supportive and pushed me in the right direction when needed. Thanks!
